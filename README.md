## System Architecture

- **Frontend:**  
  Built with Next.js and TypeScript to deliver a dynamic, responsive user experience.

- **Backend:**  
  Node.js server that provides REST APIs for user and messaging services.

- **Data Management:**  
  Uses Clerk and Stream to host and store data related to user authentication and messaging.

---

## Code Reuse

- **Clerk Authentication:**  
  Utilized pre-built components from Clerk to save development time while ensuring security.

- **Channel Management:**  
  Leveraged existing libraries for WebSocket connections and state synchronization instead of building from scratch.

- **UI Components:**  
  Adopted pre-built UI libraries for styling and responsiveness, ensuring adherence to modern design standards.

---

## CI/CD and Testing

### Testing Strategies
- **Unit Tests:**  
  Utilized Jest for testing individual components with mocking.
- **Integration Tests:**  
  Conducted end-to-end tests by manually verifying key workflows.
- **Future Improvements:**  
  Plan to increase automated test coverage and integrate testing earlier in the development cycle.

### Branching Workflow
- **Feature-Branch Workflow:**  
  Each new feature was developed in a separate branch.
- **Code Reviews:**  
  Detailed pull requests and team reviews ensured code quality and smooth merging.

---

## Deployment

- **Dockerized Application:**  
  The application is fully dockerized using a Dockerfile and docker-compose.
- **Development Environment:**  
  Uses a lightweight Node image; accessible at `localhost:3000` via `docker-compose up`.
- **Real-Time Updates:**  
  The current directory is mounted to the container, reflecting code changes immediately.

---

## Reflections

### Project Management
- **Methodology:**  
  Utilized Kanban boards and weekly sprints for task management.
- **Challenges:**  
  Integrating the Stream Chat API with Clerk authentication proved to be the most challenging due to state management across components.

### Requirements & Planning
- **Requirements Analysis:**  
  While the requirements were detailed, future iterations could benefit from deeper analysis—especially for features like audio channels.
- **Planning Gaps:**  
  Deployment and CI/CD setup were underestimated, alongside balancing team members' other responsibilities.

### Process & Environment
- **Team Communication:**  
  Weekly meetings and consistent use of a Kanban board ensured that everyone was aligned.
- **IDE Uniformity:**  
  Standardizing on Visual Studio Code (VSC) minimized environment-related issues.
- **Effort Estimation:**  
  Testing and debugging efforts were underestimated; future projects will include larger time cushions.

### Unique Learning Experiences
- **Authentication Integration:**  
  A key learning moment was debugging the Clerk.io API integration. We discovered that a slight time desynchronization on Windows 10 was causing authentication keys to expire prematurely.
- **AI Assistance:**  
  AI tools played a pivotal role in debugging error messages and suggesting UI improvements, enhancing overall productivity.

## Conclusion
This project successfully delivered a simplified Discord clone featuring robust authentication, real-time messaging, and organized channel-based communication. The experience has provided valuable insights into API integrations, CI/CD deployment, and effective team collaboration, setting a strong foundation for future enhancements.
